## 📰 Introduce

Particle Life 3D is a project that simulates particles moving and interacting in 3D space, using [Zdog](https://github.com/metafizzy/zdog) as the 3D engine. This project creates a virtual environment where particles can collide, reflect, and interact with each other based on basic physical rules.

> Inspired by my [previous project](https://github.com/tientq64/particle-life) itself, but this one in 3D.

## ⚙️ Features

* ⚛️ 3D Particle Simulation: Particles are created and move in 3D space.

* 💥 Physical Interactions: Particles interact with each other and the environment based on physical rules, including collisions and reflections.

* 🐶 Using Zdog: Utilizes Zdog, a powerful and lightweight JavaScript library, to render the particles and their interactions in 3D space.

* 🎚️ Intuitive Interface: Provides an intuitive interface to observe the movements and interactions of the particles.

## 🛠️ Usage
